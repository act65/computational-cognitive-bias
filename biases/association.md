If you only ever see rainbows and leprechauns together, how are you ever supposed to learn that they are distinct things?

People are also bad at this. Imagine that your math teacher was boring and old (as they probably were...) and that your math class was rigid and ?. How are you supposed to disentangle your experience of math into boring teacher + math?
