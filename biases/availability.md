## Availability heuristic.
(A) Should you be scared of a shark attack when swimming? (given the likelihood, no)

Instead of answering the question properly, you brain swaps it out for something easier. (B) Can I recall an image of a shark attacking a person?

Why do we do this?Â Question (A) is a hard question. Infact, it would require you to search through your entire memory, indexing every time you have been in the ocean or seen others in the ocean, to recall attacks by a shark. Instead, of collecting all the proper evidence we can recall, it is far easier to generalise from one mental image. (also related to risk adversity, save compute by just avoiding all risky things period rather than trying to evaluate them accuratly)
