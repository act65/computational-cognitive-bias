<h1>  Association</h1>

<h2>Association</h2>
<p>If you only ever see rainbows and leprechauns together, how are you ever supposed to learn that they are distinct things?</p>
<p>People are also bad at this. Imagine that your math teacher was boring and old (as they probably were&hellip;) and that your math class was rigid and ?. How are you supposed to disentangle your experience of math into boring teacher + math?</p>
<p><hr>
<h1>  Availability</h1>## Availability heuristic.
(A) Should you be scared of a shark attack when swimming? (given the likelihood, no)</p>
<p>Instead of answering the question properly, you brain swaps it out for something easier. (B) Can I recall an image of a shark attacking a person?</p>
<p>Why do we do this? Question (A) is a hard question. Infact, it would require you to search through your entire memory, indexing every time you have been in the ocean or seen others in the ocean, to recall attacks by a shark. Instead, of collecting all the proper evidence we can recall, it is far easier to generalise from one mental image. (also related to risk adversity, save compute by just avoiding all risky things period rather than trying to evaluate them accuratly)</p>
<p><hr>
<h1>  Short Term</h1>## Preferring short term rewards
We learnt to balance the uncertainty of the future (as it is too computationally expensive to have confidently accurate - aka precise?- predictions) with the rewards that could be gained in the short term.</p>
<p>In more modern times, this logic sill applies, but is not as strong. We now have science, and can think more clearly/predict the future better. Thus removing uncertainty, but we are still adapted to exploit the short term. It is also unlikely (if we live in the first world, thankfully) that we will starve to death tomorrow.</p>
