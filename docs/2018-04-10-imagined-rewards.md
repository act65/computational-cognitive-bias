Typical conditioning set up. Stimulus and reward. However, the reward recieved may be quite delayed compared to the stimulus, making it harder to learn. Two solutions; delay the stimulus, being the reward closer.

If we recieve the reward (the domaine signal) when we see food we are going to recieve (or hear the bell that always preceeds food), rather than when we consume it.

Trying to bring the reward as soon as possible. Is this TD?


This is why fantasising can be so much fun? Because we actually recieve rewards!?
We enjoy having high expectations of future reward. (whether realistic or not is a different problem)

TODO. Look into TD
