We balance the uncertainty of long term payoffs with the certainty of rewards that could be gained in the short term. (as it is too computationally expensive to have accurate predictions, thus there will always be some uncertainty)

In more modern times, this logic sillÂ applies, but is not as strong. We now have science, and can think more clearly/predict the future better. Thus pushing back the uncertainty, but we are still adapted to exploit the short term.

We now KNOW (the uncertainty has been removed) that eating sugary foods will lead to a less healthy life. And it is unlikely (if we live in the first world) that we will starve to death tomorrow.
