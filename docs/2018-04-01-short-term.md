title: Preferring short term rewards

We learnt to balance the uncertainty of the future (as it is too computationally expensive to have confidently accurate - aka precise?- predictions) with the rewards that could be gained in the short term.

In more modern times, this logic sillÂ applies, but is not as strong. We now have science, and can think more clearly/predict the future better. Thus removing uncertainty, but we are still adapted to exploit the short term. It is also unlikely (if we live in the first world, thankfully) that we will starve to death tomorrow.
