If you only ever see rainbows and leprechauns together, how are you ever supposed to learn that they are distinct things?

We manage this by using existing knowledge? But, this is a hard problem. Determining causation, but we cheat and use correlation.

How about attempting to predict what makes you happy?

People are also bad at this. Imagine that your math teacher was boring and old (as they probably were...) and that your math class was rigid and ?. How are you supposed to disentangle your experience of math into boring teacher + math?

And this flaw is exactally what most advertisements seek to exploit. Take the picture of a grassy field on some laundry power as an example. The goal is to get you to associate the environment (specifically a healthy environment) with the laundry powder. The harder question of causation, is the laundry good/bad for the environment required ?!? (computational resources.)
